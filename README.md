Patricia Plaza Rojas. Also known as Selva.
Passionate biologist and Team Leader Scientist currently transitioning into data engineering. I’m diving deep into Python, SQL, cloud architecture (AWS), and modern data workflows. With a strong foundation in scientific problem-solving, I’m now building skills in data pipelines, infrastructure as code, and warehouse design. Excited about turning complex data into insight — and always up for learning something new!
