Patricia Plaza Rojas. Also known as Selva.
Passionate Biological Scientist and Data Engineer. I’m diving deep into Python, SQL, cloud architecture (AWS), and modern data workflows. With a strong foundation in scientific problem-solving, I’m now building skills in data pipelines, infrastructure as code, and warehouse design. Excited about turning complex data into insight — and always up for learning something new!
